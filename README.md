# LSTM-Based Speech Enhancement Using STFT

## Overview
This project implements a speech denoising system using an LSTM-based neural network with direct spectrogram mapping in the STFT domain.

## Dataset
- VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset (clean and noisy speech pairs)

## Methodology
- Audio preprocessing and downsampling
- STFT-based feature extraction
- LSTM-based speech enhancement
- ISTFT-based audio reconstruction

## Results
- Average SNR improvement: **+6.32 dB**
- Objective evaluation using SNR
- Visual analysis using spectrograms

## Repository Structure
- `src/` : Training and evaluation notebooks
- `docs/`: Paper, poster, presentation, and demo materials

## Notes
This repository is part of a **Final Project (UAS)** submission.
